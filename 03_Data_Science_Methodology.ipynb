    "**Answer**\n",
    "The problem is how to tell spam emails and filter them out in our mailbox. Every day there are tons of spam emails that will be sent to our mailbox. On one hand, they cost us a lot of time and energy to differ them from the really mattered ones. On the other hand, many such emails contain malicious information, phishing links, and risky codes that threaten our privacy and safety. \n",
    "\n",
    "Spam email senders usually use fake, randomly generated email addresses which share similar words/names of the public, trusted email domains. To utilize data to identify spam emails, the question is how can we identify most spam emails by their features? \n",

    "#### Which topic did you choose to apply the data science methodology to?\n",
    "\n",
    "Briefly explain how you would complete each of the following stages for the problem that you described in the Business Understanding stage, so that you are ultimately able to answer the question that you came up with. \n",

    "  \n",
    "You can always refer to the labs as a reference with describing how you would complete each stage for your problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**\n",
    "I would complete the stages for the spam email detection problem following the data science methodology:  \n",
    "1) Analytic Approach: Since the question is to detect spam emails, it is a Yes/No question regarding an incoming email. I will select the decision tree classification approach. By checking multiple features related with spam emails, the decision is made by the end on a new email if it is a spam or not.  \n",
    "2) Data Requirements: The target data content, format, and representation are centered around the features of spam emails. Some required data include but not limited to the sender's address, sending time, the message type (broadcast, cc), sender's signature, and any sensitive words that are common in phishing letters.  \n",
    "3) Data Collection: Data can be collected from current spam letters identified by current email systems (e.g., gmail), the anti-phishing research reports/databases from Internet safety solution providers, and spontaneous spam reports by users.  \n",
    "4) Data Understanding and Preparation: We will group the data from different sources and form a unified database where each email message will be listed as one record. Each message will be prepared by labeling the identified features in its attributes. Any missing feature will be marked with some predetermined value to keep the format consistent.  \n",
    "5) Modeling and Evaluation: We will split the engineered data into the training set and test set. The training set will be used to train the classification model. By tuning the preference to the false-positive (treating a non-spam as a spam) and false-negative (accepting a spam as a normal message) results, we can select the optimal one from multiple parameter combinations. The modeling and evaluation can be performed iteratively to increase the precision of identifying spam emails."
